## Introduction

The **Galactic Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (GUSSR)** dominates the solar system after the collapse of the United States in 2024. Following a global crisis, Russia rebranded itself as the USSR, annexing U.S. territories and merging them into the **United Soviet States of America (USSA)**. Over time, the GUSSR extended its empire to planets, moons, and even dwarf planets, building a powerful and sprawling interplanetary regime. 

However, a new challenger emerges: **Maleria**, a nation born from the remnants of the U.S., invents revolutionary **hyper-warp-drive technology**, igniting a conflict that will shape the future of the solar system and beyond.

## The Pre-GUSSR Era (Up to 2024)

1. **1945**: End of World War II, the emergence of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union.
2. **1991**: Collapse of the Soviet Union in the real world, leading to the rise of the Russian Federation.
3. **2020**: U.S.-China tensions reach a new high with trade wars, military standoffs, and political maneuvering.
4. **2024**: Kamala Harris wins the U.S. presidential election, causing economic collapse, political instability, and the eventual downfall of the U.S. government.
5. **2024-2025**: In the wake of the U.S. collapse, Russia rebrands itself as the **USSR** once more and begins absorbing the United States' territory, leading to the creation of the **United Soviet States of America** (USSA).

## The Dwarf Planet Exile (2100s)

14. **2105**: The GUSSR begins a ruthless campaign of consolidation, pushing all remaining sovereign nations to the dwarf planets, including China, Taiwan, and the U.S.
15. **2110**: **Maleria** splits from the U.S., declaring independence and beginning a new chapter in space colonization.
16. **2112**: **Maleria** invents **hyper-warp-drive technology**, capable of traveling 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 times the speed of light.
17. **2113**: The GUSSR attempts to steal the hyper-warp technology from **Maleria**, but is thwarted by a **defensive alliance** between **China, Taiwan, and Maleria**, known as the **Hyperlight Coalition**.
18. **2115**: The Hyperlight Coalition successfully repels GUSSR’s attempts to infiltrate Maleria’s research facilities.

## The Great Space Race (2110s-2200s)

19. **2118**: The first interplanetary war between the GUSSR and the Hyperlight Coalition erupts as Maleria begins to deploy hyper-warp ships capable of reaching distant exoplanets.
20. **2120**: **Maleria**, with the help of Taiwan and China, launches a successful raid on GUSSR supply lines in the asteroid belt, crippling their mining operations.
21. **2125**: The GUSSR begins constructing a new fleet of super-fast ships designed to counter hyper-warp technology, attempting to regain control of the solar system.
22. **2130**: A massive **space battle** breaks out near the outer regions of Saturn, involving both hyper-warp and conventional spacecraft. The GUSSR suffers heavy losses, and its strategic control over the outer solar system begins to crumble.
23. **2135**: GUSSR retaliates by secretly developing a **Plasma Weapon** designed to neutralize the speed of hyper-warp travel.
24. **2140**: The first successful deployment of a **hyper-warp** fleet by the **Hyperlight Coalition** sees their forces moving across the galaxy at previously unimaginable speeds, vastly outpacing the GUSSR’s response times.

26. **2210**: The GUSSR, in a desperate bid to retain control, begins moving towards **full militarization**, increasing its fleet size and bolstering defenses around key planets like Venus and Earth.
27. **2215**: Colonies in the outer solar system begin to demand autonomy, leading to rebellions in Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Strikes and revolts spread across multiple moons.
28. **2220**: The GUSSR learns of the existence of an alien race, leading to an unprecedented arms race as both factions race to secure alien technologies.
29. **2230**: Tensions rise between the **GUSSR** and **Hyperlight Coalition**, leading to multiple incidents along the border territories of the asteroid belt.
